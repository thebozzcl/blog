I'm Rodrigo Bozzolo, a software engineer from Chile currently living in Seattle.

I studied Industrial Engineering with a diploma in Computer Science, which means I 
know a mix of business management, finance, supply chain management and lots of 
other fields, along with typical SWE stuff. I mostly focus on the SWE side, but knowing
about all these topics lets me gain a good understanding of the businesses I work for.

My main focuses as a software engineer are designing scalable and complete systems
with components that promote re-use. I like applying this approach to data processing
and workflows, which has been most of my work so far.

Outside of work, my interests include (but are not limited to) tech in general, video
games, music, musical instruments and cars.

The purpose of this blog is to be an outlet for my creative and tech endeavors, as well
as a way to practice my writing skills. I'm very open to feedback, so please feel free
to post a comment or email me if you got any advice or questions!
