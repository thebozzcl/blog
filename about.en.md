Hi all! My name's Rodrigo Bozzolo. I'm an industrial engineer from Chile. Right now I'm living in Seattle, working as a software developer.

I have a pretty broad range of interests, outside software development. Music, technology, math, and all sorts of nerdy stuff! I like writing about all of that and the stuff I do, along with reflections on my life and current situations.

I've been wanting to learn more front-end development, so I decided to try building my own site from scratch!
