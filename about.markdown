My name's Rodrigo Bozzolo. I'm a software dev from Chile, currently based in Seattle.

I have a pretty broad set of interests, ranging from technology to music, and I wanted a place where I could talk more about them. Besides, it's interesting to veer off the beaten path and try my hand at writing a website!

Quickly testing my pipeline setup.
