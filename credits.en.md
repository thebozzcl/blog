I think it's worthwhile to give a shout-out to the tools I'm using for this site. All of this is open-source or free to use!

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generation framework. It was very easy to set up and get running! I'm still using the default theme, [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), with a few modifications. Localization is done using the [Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot) plugin for Jekyll. Comments are provided by [FastComments](https://fastcomments.com/).

The code for my site is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thebozzcl/thebozzcl.github.io). It's built using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
