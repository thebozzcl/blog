I think it's worthwhile to give a shout-out to the tools I'm using for this site. Most of this is open-source or free to use!

Frameworks and infrastructure:
* This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a simple and fast static site generation framework.
* The code for my site is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thebozzcl/thebozzcl.github.io).
* I'm self-hosting this site on a [Raspberry Pi 4 model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) using [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/).
* I got my certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), using the [EFF's Certbot tool](https://certbot.eff.org/).

Plug-ins and libraries:
* I'm using a slightly modified version of the default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme for Jekyll.
* Localization is done using the [Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot) plug-in for Jekyll.
* **PAID ($5.00/month)**: Comments are provided by [FastComments](https://fastcomments.com/).
