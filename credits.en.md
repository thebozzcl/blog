I think it's worthwhile to give a shout-out to the tools I'm using for this site. Most of this is open-source or free to use!

Frameworks and infrastructure:
* This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a simple and fast static site generation framework.
* The code for my site is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thebozzcl/thebozzcl.github.io).
* Site updates are built using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) so I could add support for custom plug-ins. Otherwise, you're limited to [these officially supported plug-ins](https://pages.github.com/versions/).
* This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Plug-ins and libraries:
* I'm using a slightly modified version of the default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
* Localization is done using the [Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot) plug-in for Jekyll.
* **PAID ($5.00/month)**: Comments are provided by [FastComments](https://fastcomments.com/).
